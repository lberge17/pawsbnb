# PawsBnB

This project is a part of the Flatiron School Curriculum. The goal of the project was to create a ReactJS frontend with a Rails API backend. The application, PawsBnb, is intended as a business manager app for small-scale, at-home pet businesses. Pet care providers can sign up for an account and then add their client list and schedule any appointments they have. The businesses on PawsBnB are all listed on the businesses page for anyone to see in case they wanted to find an at-home pet sitter, dog walker, groomer, etc.
